## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

* I learned how to implement consistent local storage theme for storing the user preferred theme.
* Implementation of global consistent app state using zustand
* Setting up project and configuring the tailwind.config.js file correctly
* How to write a good README.md file (I very poor at this at the moment)
* ...

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
// Some code I managed to get my hands robbed with
import {create} from "zustand";
const globalAppStore = create((set) =>({
  theme: "",
  setTheme: (value) =>{
      set({theme: value});
  }
}))
```
